Phoebe has three serious relationships over the show's run: David, a scientist, in season one, whom she breaks up with when he moves to Minsk on a research grant; Gary, a police officer whose badge she finds, in season five; and an on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten.

He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being the son of an erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father.

<h1> Q&A </h1>
<h3> "But they don't know that we know they know we know!"  </h3>
<br/>
<b><u>Q1</b></u>
<br>
The diffrence between web1 web2 & web3 are:
<br>
web1 - The readable version of internet where we used to get information.
<br>
<br>
web2 - The information came from the users.
<br>
<br>
web3 - The information a user see based on is own perferences.
<br>
<br>
or as you can see in details on this website: (I rather not copy from the net because it is kind of stealing)
<br>
<br>
<iframe src=https://wittycookie.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/what-are-the-major-differences-among-web-1-0-2-0-and-3-0/ width=500 height=500></iframe>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Q2</b></u>
<br>
When using web1 to find "Side effects of drugs" the user gets a list of websites containing text about "Side effects of drugs" in general probably not very accurate.
<br>
<br>
When using web2 to find "Side effects of drugs" the user gets a list of websites that contain knowledge shared by many people,
which makes the internet widely rich with data. 
<br>
<br>
When using web3 the search engine knows what drug you're using and shows you the most relavant websites to you,
fitting the information espically to you by AI algorithms, gather data togther and display it to you.
<br>
if you will search the same query via other user the answer will definitely be different.
